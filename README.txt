**luhn_abstract** is a Python module for automatically generating an abstract from a document using unsupervised techniques.  The Luhn paper was published in 1958, and the general concept of the algorithm is outlined in the diagram below.

# Dependencies

[57] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP
(although rarely made explicit)[58] and developments in artificial intelligence,
specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches[59] and
new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle[60]
by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College London Karl J.
Friston. [15.6250] [9] In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University
of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single
hidden layer to language modelling,[10] and in the following years he went on to
develop Word2vec. [14.2258] It is primarily concerned with providing computers with
the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related
to information retrieval, knowledge representation and computational linguistics, a
subfield of linguistics. [12.9706] Major tasks in natural language processing are
speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and
natural-language generation. [12.5000] Machine learning approaches, which include
both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over
the symbolic approach:  Although rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were
still in use in 2020, they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in
2023. [12.2500]
